### BDD
Title: Ghanian Day Names Calculator.

As the Developer,
I want the Application to display a user's Akan name when the enter date button is clicked on the landing page.
 Given that a user has entered their date of birth in the format:mm/dd/yyyy
and they have entered their gender as either male or female
when they enter these details on the prompt after pressing the enter date born button
then the Akan name should be displayed in the box above the enter date born button
and if the information entered is incorrect then an error message should be displayed in the box.
